        "# Q-20) How do we interpret coefficients in Logistic Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans) In logistic regression, the coefficients represent the change in the log odds of the dependent event occurring for a one-unit increase in the predictor variable, holding all other variables constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "->  More intuitively, by exponentiating a coefficient, we obtain the odds ratio, which indicates how the odds of the event change with a one-unit increase in the predictor.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Interpreting Coefficients:\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Positive Coefficient: A positive coefficient implies that as the predictor variable increases, the log odds of the outcome occurring also increase, leading to higher odds of the event.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> For example, if a predictor's coefficient is 0.5, the odds ratio is exp(0.5) ≈ 1.65, meaning the odds of the event are 1.65 times higher for each one-unit increase in the predictor.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Negative Coefficient: Conversely, a negative coefficient indicates that as the predictor variable increases, the log odds of the outcome decrease, resulting in lower odds of the event.\n",
        "\n",
        "->  For instance, a coefficient of -0.7 yields an odds ratio of exp(-0.7) ≈ 0.50, suggesting the odds of the event are halved for each one-unit increase in the predictor."
